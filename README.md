# 🐍 ML Project: Data Analysis with Python

## 🔍 Overview
This project provides a complete data analysis workflow using Python to explore, clean, and interpret a dataset. The **Final Report notebook** demonstrates end-to-end analysis including exploratory visualizations, data transformations, and summary findings.

## 👩‍💻 Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`)
- Data libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`
- Visualization libraries: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Optional: `scikit-learn` if modeling was involved
