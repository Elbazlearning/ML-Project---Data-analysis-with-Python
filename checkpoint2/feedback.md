I have serious concerns about your initial analysis here. First, I note that you have three monthly values in your weather data - prec, tmin, tmax.  You appear to have brought this into a column.  However, the way your data is organized, I think you really want each of these to be on the same row for each month, hence something more like:

| Month1_prec | Month2_tmax | Month1_tmax | Month2_prec | Month1_tmin | ... | Month12_tmax |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

That way, you'll be able to use all of the weather data in each month to make a prediction about yield.

I'm also not sure you're merge is working right.  You currently have:

```python
merged_data = pd.merge(corn_df_aggregated, merged_regions_df, on='Year', how='inner')
```
but it seems to me you should be merging on both Year and Region?  Moreover, once you've got your data so organized, you might want to examine several different heatmaps - one for precipitation, one for temp.

Your PCA and clustering, which are applied without discretion to several different types of data and are completely unexamined (how did you choose the number of clusters?) and not clearly motivated.  Why are you doing this?  You probably don't need to.

Noting this:

```python
# Add hypothetical actual labels for demonstration (for an actual task, replace this with real labels)
# Assuming binary classification for simplicity
df['Actual'] = np.random.randint(0, 2, df.shape[0])
```
So, your F1 score is based on unexamined example code from ChatGPT.

All you really need to do here is run a regression to predict crop yields given monthly weather patterns, but you need to organize your data correctly in order to do this.  I don't know why you are trying to reduce and cluster your data, but you only a very small number of values to predict, and so you probably don't have any computational limitations.  Given the shape of your data (relatively many columns for relatively few rows), you will likely have overfitting problems.  

According to my understanding, you have 7 years and 9 regions.  This is 63 datapoints.  That is very likely not going to be enough to do anything with.  You would be better off either: a) doing this at the county level, if you can find relevant meteorological data or b) doing this analysis across a much broader geographical range.  With 7 years of data, I'd want something more like 100 regions.

You have a lot of work to do here.
